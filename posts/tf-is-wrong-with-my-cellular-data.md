Since February, I noticed my cellular data is getting slower everyday (only at my home) especially 6PM to 10PM

I'm getting mad, the internet is slower than a snail...

Sycig data up to Google Drive make it worse, plus the internet that is already slow

## How do I fix this?

Fortunately, the report system of the ISP website is very fast, evenn though my Google Drive is dying

I reported this problem, hoping they will fix this as soon as possible, otherwise, still I will not consider migrate

Because there are not even decent speed ISP here.
