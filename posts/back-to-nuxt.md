February 22nd Today

Second post now about my own website (never-ending, smh - -*)

Moved back from Svelte to Nuxt, as usual.

To sum up the issue from the last post: I think it was due to some weird Windows behavior. Today I tried cloning an old commit (before switching to Svelte) and it worked fine.

## Summary of Changes

- Switched back to Nuxt.js  
- Added ripple effect for `.card`  
- New theming, now more in line with Google's design  
- CSS: Added new variables, borrowed from [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io)

Current time: 17:37 â€” done for the day.
