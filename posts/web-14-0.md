## Yayayayayayayay

My website used to have blog system, unntil it broke downn and I'm too lazy to fix it.

Now I have it again, with new looking, that use over 600 lines of CSS

## Theming

I copied Material Design 3 from Google but instead of using Flutter, I wrote it entirely using Nuxt and pure CSS (no Tailwind)

## Blog system

Not much about blog, I used Pocketbase and then fetch the data here, then map it

I promise I will not rewrite the website again, because this design looks stunning
