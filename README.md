# Content

A repository that just do host my content on my own website, nothing else.

## Known-issues

- Cannot use dot, any URL illegal character or whitespace (` `) in the file name such as `web-15.0.md` or `$ $#*( $#~.md`. Best practice is to use only `_` (underscore) or `-` (dash) as a separator.
